      <h2>How will life on earth end?</h2>
      <p>
        Asteroid strikes, supernovae blasts, and other calamities could take out
        humanity. But no matter what, a cataclysmic event 1 billion years from
        now will likely rob the planet of oxygen, wiping out life.

        Life is resilient. The first living things on Earth appeared as far back
        as 4 billion years ago, according to some scientists. At the time, our
        planet was still being pummeled by huge space rocks. But life persisted
        anyway. And throughout Earth’s history, it’s seen all manner of
        cataclysms. Disparate doomsdays — from supernovae blasts and asteroid
        strikes to huge volcanic eruptions and sudden climate shifts — have
        killed countless lifeforms. And at times, those mass extinctions have
        even eliminated most species on Earth. Yet, life has always rebounded.
        New species emerge. The cycle repeats. So, what would it take to kill
        off life in full? Well, it turns out that while humanity might be
        surprisingly fragile, it’s not easy to sterilize an entire planet.
        Nonetheless, below are just a few possible doomsday events that could
        permanently extinguish all life on Earth — and the last one is likely
        unavoidable.

      <h3>Asteroid impact apocalypse</h3>
      <p>
        When a city-sized asteroid struck the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years
        ago, it was game over for the dinosaurs, as well as most other species
        on Earth at the time. And while our ancestors hadn’t yet evolved, the
        impact was perhaps the single most important event in human history.
        Without that asteroid strike, dinosaurs might have continued to rule the
        Earth, leaving us mammals still cowering in the shadows.

        Humans, however, won’t always be on the winning side of such random
        events. A future asteroid could just as easily take out every person on
        Earth. Fortunately, that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon. Based on the
        geological record of cosmic impacts, Earth gets hit by a large asteroid
        roughly every 100 million years, according to NASA. However, smaller
        asteroid impacts do happen all the time. There’s even evidence that some
        people may have been killed by small meteorite impacts within the past
        few thousand years. But what are the chances that our planet will ever
        be struck by an asteroid massive enough to wipe out all life on Earth?
        Simulations published in Nature back in 2017 suggest it would take a
        truly gigantic space rock to accomplish such a feat. Killing all life on
        Earth would require an impact that literally boils away the oceans. And
        only asteroids like Pallas and Vesta — the solar system’s largest — are
        big enough to do that. There is evidence that infant Earth was struck by
        a large planetoid called Theia. But these days, collisions of such large
        objects are extremely unlikely.
